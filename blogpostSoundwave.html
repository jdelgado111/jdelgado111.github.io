            <p>Soundwave (aka Soundblaster) is one of Megatron's most reliable troops, and he has positioned himself comfortably and irreplaceably in the Decepticon upper command structure. Though "only" Communications Officer, Soundwave stands at Megatron's side as a confidant, comparable in rank to Starscream and Shockwave, but unlike them, entirely loyal to his leader.</p>

            <p>Though stoic and possessed of little outward personality (as evidenced by his monotone computer-style speech), Soundwave is not without drives: he has worked hard to get where he is, and he guards his place in the Decepticon hierarchy fiercely.</p>

            <p>On top of hearing all in his role as Communications Officer and Decepticon spy-master, he is actually capable of "reading minds" by scanning and decoding the electrical impulses that carry "thoughts" in both organics and Cybertronians, and he will not hesitate to use what he learns as blackmail to keep himself high in Megatron's esteem.</p>
            
            <p>As such, Soundwave is not popular among the rank-and-file Decepticons, who see him as a two-faced snake and wouldn't mind abandoning him on the battlefield—if they thought Megatron would let them get away with it.</p>
            
            <p>Soundwave commands an ever-growing legion of cassette troops to carry out tasks big and small. Stored within his signature chest compartment and called forth on Soundwave's whim with a push of a button, these miniature menaces are most commonly employed as spies for either the Decepticon cause or Soundwave's personal objectives, but are just as effective as warriors, and are entirely devoted to their master.</p>

            <div class="caption caption2">IDW Comics</div>
            
            <p>The 2005 IDW comics expand on Soundwave's background. An outlier with extremely powerful hearing and limited telepathic capabilities, Soundwave's unusual powers made him a freak and an outcast in the stifling days of functionist Cybertron. But after finding a mentor in Ravage, Soundwave's aspirations saw him join up with Megatron's Decepticon movement, dreaming of a Cybertron where every Cybertronian could stand as true equals.</p>
            
            <p>In this new role, Soundwave remained a loyal Decepticon for millennia—making one increasingly dubious compromise after the next—until after the end of the Great War, when Megatron, the 'bot who had led him down this path, saw the error of his own ways and defected to the Autobots.</p>
            
            <p>Shattered by this betrayal, Soundwave fell in with the ambitious warlord Galvatron in a new bid to return the Decepticon cause back to its roots: a pacifistic faction advocating for equality amongst Cybertronians.</p>
            
            <p>But Galvatron's own bloodlust precluded any hope of true peace, and when the uneasy alliance fell apart Soundwave did the unthinkable: joining forces with Optimus Prime. Refusing to formally join the Autobot cause, Soundwave continues to proudly wear his purple Decepticon insignia, a badge of honor that, to some, marks him as the last true Decepticon.</p>

            <div class="caption caption3">G1 Original Toy</div>
            
            <p>Soundwave began life as the Micro Change toy "Cassette Man", and went mostly unchanged when he was imported by Hasbro to become part of the Transformers toyline, save for exclusion of some accessories, and the removal of a molded "Cassette Man" logo and "MC-10" on his cassette door.</p>
            
            <p>He transforms into a realistically-sized blue and silver microcassette recorder, complete with an opening cassette door that can accommodate any of the numerous Mini-Cassette figures, and came packaged with Buzzsaw to fully exploit and advertise this interactive gimmick.</p>
            
            <p>Soundwave is armed with a shoulder-mounted cannon and a hand-held concussion blaster, which both transform into imitation batteries that store in a compartment on his back while he is in his alternate mode. The Hasbro instructions mistakenly state that a pair of trapezoid-shaped stickers intended to decorate these batteries should be attached to Soundwave's legs.</p>
            
            <p>In Europe, Soundwave was released in three different subsequent versions that are most notable due to packaging variations: The first version, released in 1985, was manufactured by Takara and featured a Milton Bradley logo on its packaging; the second version, released in 1986, was also manufactured by Takara, but now featured a Hasbro logo on its packaging; and the third version, also released in 1986, was now manufactured by Ceji (the parent company of Joustra) and still featured a Hasbro logo on its packaging.</p>
