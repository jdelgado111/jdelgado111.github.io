            <p>Ratchet is the Autobots' Chief Medical Officer. If something's broke, he can fix it. Ratchet is known for his irreverent bedside manner; he loves having a good time, and his party-loving nature has given him a dry wit. He is not a particularly mighty warrior, which sometimes leads him to believe that he is expendable. Optimus Prime has trouble convincing Ratchet that this is far from the truth.</p>

            <p>Although he's a healer, Ratchet often finds himself on the front lines of combat and, on occasion, the last hope the Autobots have. These pressures are sometimes too much for him to handle, but Ratchet ultimately never gives up.</p>

            <p>His vehicle mode sometimes splits into his robot and a separate component. In some universes, he can combine with his fellow Autobots to form Defensor, Sky Reign or Modulus.</p>
            
            <p>In the Generation One cartoon continuity, Ratchet was the chief medical officer aboard the Ark and continued to serve in that capacity for Optimus Prime's forces on Earth during the mid-1980s. He formed something of a friendly rivalry with the human Sparkplug Witwicky, who often assisted him in his repairs. In 2005, Ratchet was killed by the Decepticons just prior to the Battle of Autobot City. His body was interred on the Autobot Mausoleum, but it was ultimately destroyed in an explosion.</p>
            
            <p>In a splinter timeline, Ratchet was eventually revived through means unknown, and in 2011, joined the Disaster Relief Team to aid Autobots caught in the destruction of Cybertron. By 2021, Ratchet had helped to restore Cybertron to its former state. In the 2030s, he joined his teammates in battling Grand Scourge.</p>

            <div class="caption caption2">IDW Comics</div>
            
            <p>The 2005 IDW comics feature a slightly different version of Ratchet. Once a bright and idealistic doctor, this Ratchet found his youthful optimism tempered as Cybertron descended into millions of years of civil war, giving rise to a brand of world-weary cynicism all his own.</p>
            
            <p>This cantankerous and sometimes gruff attitude is something of a façade he's deliberately cultivated to hide his natural compassion for his fellow Autobots and innocent organics, a personality trait that's come in handy more than once during his adventures on Earth.</p>
            
            <p>Following the end of the war, Ratchet's war-weariness led him to leave Cybertron aboard the Lost Light, embarking on a series of adventures across the galaxy that saw him come to terms with his advancing age while battling demons from his past.</p> 
            
            <p>Despite captain Rodimus's objective to find the mythical Knights of Cybertron, Ratchet remains a staunch atheist and a firm believer in empirical science—something that irritates his friend and frequent verbal sparring partner Drift to no end.</p>
            
            <p>Ratchet's first appearance in this continuity was in The Transformers: Infiltration #0, written by veteran Transformers writer Simon Furman at the beginning of the IDW continuity. Chronologically, his first appearance in the timeline occurs during the More Than Meets the Eye run, written by James Roberts, which details his actions before joining the Autobots as well as how he ultimately joins the cause.</p>

            <div class="caption caption3">G1 Original Toy</div>
            
            <p>The Transformers Ratchet was originally a Onebox Ambulance Type toy from Takara's Diaclone line before Hasbro brought Transformers to North America. The toy transforms from a Nissan Cherry Vanette SGL Coach ambulance to a robot and gun-station.</p>
            
            <p>A variant of the toy includes red crosses on the top and sides of the vehicle. Ratchet and his retool/redeco buddy Ironhide, like all Diaclones, were designed to be piloted mecha, which is why he has a seat instead of a head. The Transformers version applied a face sticker to the back of the seat in lieu of a real sculpted noggin.</p>
            
            <p>In 1986, he was made available as a mail-away item (as he was no longer shipping to retail shelves) in multiple offers, including the Digital Doom on the Highway to Destruction flier packed with most boxed Transformers toys. He cost $8 and two Robot Points.</p>
            
            <p>In Japan, Ratchet was originally only available as a S.T.A.R.S. mail-away, costing 1700 yen and 4 robot points.</p>
